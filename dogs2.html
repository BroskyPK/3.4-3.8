	<h1>Dogs</h1>
	<p>Find out everything you need to know about owning a dog or adopting one from Toni's Animal Shelter.</p>
	<h2>Adopt a Dog</h3>
	<p>We have a very active rehome programme that produces fantastic results.</p>
	<p>We get help from the SPCA, HUHA and other rescue organisations for our dog rehome programme. 
	All our dogs are temperament tested to make sure they're suitable for rehoming, microchipped and are required to be desexed (vouchers are available).</p>
	<h3>What do the adoption costs cover?</h4>
	<p>Our adoption service costs can include:</p>
	<li>a $35 vaccination fee</li>
	<li>a desexing voucher (once you apply - depending on weight and sex of dog)</li>
	<li>the registration fee for the year (pro-rata for the year)</li>
	<h3>What dogs are available?</h4>
	<p>To see what dogs are available for adoption, take a look at the Animal Services Facebook page.</p>
	<h2>How to adopt a dog</h3>
	<p>If you're interested in adopting a dog:</p>

	<p>If you're a prospective owner, you'll need to have have a property inspection to show that you have dog-free access to the front door.</p>
